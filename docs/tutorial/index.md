# Getting Started

Welcome to the tutorial !

In this tutorial, we'll build a Health and Wellbeing survey using SurveyCompo. This survey is perfect for research purposes, collecting valuable insights into participants' lifestyles, diet, and mental health. This survey targets participants 18 years or older. We'll incorporate logic to ensure younger users are ineligible.


## Building a Health and Wellbeing Survey
Let's take a look at the questions we'll be turning into an interactive survey:

**Demographics and Lifestyle**

- Question 1: What is your age group?
- Question 2: How often do you exercise?
- Question 3: On average, how many hours of sleep do you get per night?

**Diet and Nutrition**

- Question 4: How many servings of fruits and vegetables do you typically eat per day?
- Question 5: Please select all that apply to your diet (Options: Vegetarian, Vegan, Gluten-Free, Dairy-Free, Other).

**Mental Wellbeing**

- Question 6: Over the past two weeks, how often have you felt down, depressed, or hopeless?
- Question 7: Please describe your current stress level.
- Question 8: Do you have any additional comments about your health and wellbeing?


## Tutorial Roadmap

1. **The Survey Builder**: We'll use this powerful tool to easily construct our survey with code completion and validation.
1. **Survey Structure**: We'll learn how SurveyCompo uses JSON to define surveys.
3. **Adding Logic**: We'll ensure the survey is restricted to participants 18 and older.
4. **Advanced Features**: Dive into piping, disqualification logic, randomization, and other tools to tailor the survey experience.
