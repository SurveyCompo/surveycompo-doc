# Publishing Surveys

Congratulations! You have created a survey and now you are ready to publish it.
Publishing a surveys means making it available to your audience so that they can respond to it.

If you make any changes to a survey after publishing it, you will need to publish the survey again to make the changes available to your audience.

There are two ways to publish a survey:

1. **Hosted Surveys**: You can host the survey on our servers. This is the easiest way to publish a survey. You can share the survey link with your audience and start collecting responses.

2. **Self-hosted Surveys**: You can host the survey on your own website or application. This gives you full control over the survey experience and data. You can also integrate the survey with your existing tools and workflows.

Publishing a survey is a simple process. You can publish a survey from the Survey Details page and choose the publishing method.
